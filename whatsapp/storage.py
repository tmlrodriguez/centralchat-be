        Description:
        - Provide private filesystem storage for WhatsApp media binaries.
        - Prevent Django from generating public media URLs for stored WhatsApp content.

        Notes:
        - Files are served only through authenticated Dialoqo views.
        - The storage location must not be mapped directly through the web server.
        - Production may replace this implementation with private S3-compatible object storage without changing the media-domain operations.
