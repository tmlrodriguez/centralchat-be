        Description:
        - Queue asynchronous private storage of a WhatsApp media attachment after the current database transaction commits.

        Notes:
        - Celery must never receive attachment identifiers from transactions that later roll back.
        - The task import is intentionally deferred until after transaction commit to prevent circular imports between operations and Celery tasks.
        - The task itself remains idempotent if the attachment has already been stored.

            Notes:
            - Deferred import prevents operations.py -> task_operations.py -> tasks.py -> operations.py circular dependency.
